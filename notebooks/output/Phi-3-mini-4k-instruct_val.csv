This change introduces a new flag to allow callers to add information to the user agent without replacing it entirely.

This allows people re-packaging or wrapping Certbot to influence its user agent string. They may which to do this so that stats/metrics related to their distribution are available to boulder.

This is beneficial for both the Certbot team and the party re-packaging Certbot as it allows the custom user agent to match the Certbot user agent as closely as possible, allowing data about use of the re-packaged version to be collected along side or separately from vanilla certbot.

Resolves #4682"," In the pull request, changes are made to the `certbot/cli.py` and `certbot/client.py` files. In `certbot/cli.py`, a new optional argument `--user-agent-comment` is added to the `certonly` subparser, allowing users to add a comment to the default user agent string. This change is intended to allow additional statistical data to be collected when repackaging Certbot or calling it from another tool.In `certbot/client.py`, the `determine_user_agent` function is updated to include the new `--user-agent-comment` argument in the user agent string. Additionally, the function now includes the Python version in the user agent string.The new `_user_agent_comment_type` function is also introduced in `certbot/client.py` to validate the user agent comment input, ensuring it does not contain parentheses."

Bumps [prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/tree/HEAD/packages/cli) from 4.11.0 to 4.13.0.

Release notes
Sourced from prisma's releases.

4.13.0
üåü Help us spread the word about Prisma by starring the repo or tweeting about the release. üåü
Highlights
Introspection stopgaps
The Prisma Schema Language (PSL) currently doesn't support all database features and functionality of our target databases. The PSL is an abstraction over SQL and will keep evolving to address gaps in our database feature matrix.
Before this release, prisma db pull did not pick up the unsupported features in a database. It was easy to lose them when running prisma migrate dev based on an existing Prisma schema if not included in a migration file using custom migrations.
To avoid this, we added Introspection Stopgaps that surface the existence of these features in your database and link to our documentation on how to manually work around the Prisma Schema with unsupported database features (‚ÄùStopgaps‚Äù as we will remove them as soon as we implement full support for these features).
In this release, we added stopgaps for the following features:

Partitioned tables
PostgreSQL Row Level Security
Index sort order, NULLS FIRST / NULLS LAST
CockroachDB row-level TTL
Comments
PostgreSQL deferred constraints

Prisma CLI will output warnings on introspection (prisma db pull) and add comments to your Prisma schema. In the coming releases, we will expand this to many more features labeled with topic: database-functionality on GitHub.
Improved support for Netlify and Vercel build process
Netlify and Vercel cache project dependencies during the build process and reuse that cache until dependencies change. While this helps speed up the build process, any postinstall scripts of these dependencies will not be executed.
Prisma uses a postinstall script in its package to automatically trigger the customized generation of Prisma Client for your Prisma Schema. When a dependency cache is used, that generation process is not triggered, and an outdated Prisma Client may be used in your application.
When you update your Prisma Schema but not your dependencies, Prisma Client will not be generated for the new schema. For example, columns you added recently to one of your models will not be present in the Prisma Client API - causing errors.
This problem can be avoided by:

Adding a custom postinstall script in your package.json file
Manually adding a prisma generate step to the ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù scripts of Vercel and Netlify.

We now added detection of this scenario and will prevent a build without an additional prisma generate. This will ensure you're aware of the problem early and get guidance on how to fix this problem. You can read more on how to do this in our docs ‚Äî Vercel caching troubleshooting, Netlify caching troubleshooting.
Better support for pnpm as a package manager
Before this release, Prisma only used npm scripts which would lead to undesirable behavior for a project using a different package manager such as pnpm and yarn. This release improves the detection of the package managers in your project by using ni. If you're still running into this problem, let us know by creating a GitHub issue.
Segmentation fault and TLS connection error fix
In this release, we've fixed a TLS connection error segmentation fault. This mostly affected users running on Node.js 17 or later with OpenSSL 1.1 when using TLS to connect to their database.
JSON protocol Preview feature feedback
We have fixed multiple bugs for the jsonProtocol Preview feature and are close to making it Generally Available. We are still looking for feedback about its usage to ensure it is ready and works as expected for everyone.

Closes #2017 
"," The changes described in the pull request summary are as follows:1. Creation of a new variable `boulder_preexists` set to `False`.2. Addition of a new block of code that checks if a Boulder server already exists. If it does, the variable `boulder_preexists` is set to `True`.3. Modification of the code that creates client instances. If `cl_args.boulderonly` is set to `True`, the code will exit. Otherwise, it will create client instances in parallel.4. Addition of a new function `config_and_launch_boulder` that configures and launches the Boulder server.5. Modification of the code that terminates the Boulder server. If `cl_args.killboulder` is set to `True`, the Boulder server will be terminated.6. Addition of a new function `block_until_http_ready` that waits for the Boulder server to be ready for HTTP requests.7. Modification of the code that installs and runs the test script. If `cl_args.saveinstances` is set to `False`, the code will terminate and clean up the instances. If `cl_args.saveinstances` is set to `True`, the code will run the test script in a virtual environment.These changes aim to improve the functionality of the code by adding parallelism, allowing for the creation of multiple client instances, and providing more control over the Boulder server. The addition of the `boulder_preexists` variable helps to avoid unnecessary creation of Boulder servers. The modification of the code that terminates the Boulder server provides more flexibility in managing the server. The new functions `config_and_launch_boulder` and `block_until_http0_ready` help to simplify the code and make it more modular. The modification of the code that installs and runs the test script allows for more flexibility in managing instances."

Previously in this series: #247, #515, #948, #2686.

The Go case was caught, again, on issue tracker: , . This PR is *not* expected to resolve the overall tickets, though.

The fix for viu is speculative, as the reporter in the upstream ticket (ytdl-org/youtube-dl#30779) used the direct stream URL instead of the player frontend URL. It is not certain if this will work, as I have no means to test it.

As a side note, the viu extractor contains a somewhat curious FIXME comment, which I did not address here, but I think is worth paying some attention to:

Hi üëã ,
thanks for this awesome work. I gave it a partial read and found a typo.
Best"," Description of pull request:This pull request addresses the differences in the output of the fourth code snippet due to a peephole optimization technique known as Constant folding. Constant folding is a compile-time optimization that replaces expressions with their constant values, resulting in a more efficient runtime. In this case, the expression `'a'*20` is replaced by the constant string `'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'`. However, it's important to note that Constant folding was moved out from the peephole optimizer to the new AST optimizer in Python 3.7, which means the third and fourth code snippets may not work as expected in Python 3.7. The pull request aims to improve the understanding and compatibility of Constant folding across different Python versions."

Fixes an error where pathlib incorrectly detects the name for some URLs. Used when passing an authenticated url as the data argument

## üõ†Ô∏è PR Summary

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/actions)

### üåü Summary
Improvement in file name parsing for remote file downloading.

### üìä Key Changes
- Simplified the parsing of file names from URLs by changing the order of operations‚Äîfirst stripping the query parameters and then extracting the name.

### üéØ Purpose & Impact
- **Enhances File Handling**: This tweak ensures that file names are extracted correctly, without any appended URL parameters that could cause errors.
- **Improves Robustness**: The update strengthens the download process, preventing potential file naming issues and ensuring successful downloads for users.
- **User Experience**: Users dealing with remote files can expect a more seamless experience with less risk of encountering file-related errors while using the code."," Modify the check_file function to handle URLs with query parameters by splitting the URL and extracting the filename, and add a print statement to indicate the download process. Additionally, include a check to ensure the downloaded file exists and has a non-zero size."

Fixes TB logging for classification training. @AyushExel 

## üõ†Ô∏è PR Summary

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/actions)

### üåü Summary
Improved logging of training metrics with epoch information in Ultralytics YOLOv5.

### üìä Key Changes
- `classifier.py`: Added epoch number to the `logger.log_metrics` function call.
- `utils/loggers/__init__.py`: Updated the `log_metrics` method to accept an additional `epoch` parameter.

### üéØ Purpose & Impact
- **Purpose**: To enhance the logging functionality by including epoch information, enabling better tracking and visualization of training progress over time.
- **Impact**: Users will now see metrics logged with corresponding epoch numbers, improving the interpretability of training logs in tools like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases. üìà This change enhances debugging and analysis for developers, researchers, and practitioners working with the YOLOv5 model.", Change the logging behavior in the __init__.py file of the utils/loggers module:Modify the log_metrics method to accept an additional parameter for epoch and update the TensorBoard logging to include the epoch information.

78,"Cleans all DBs on ./breeze stop
When ./breeze stop is run, we run docker-compose down under the
hood - by default with --volumes flag which also removes the
volumes. But the volumes were only defined when you
selected the database.

We want to clean up all the volumes on breeze stop
in order to avoid surprizes when you switch the DB and find
the DB is there.

Otherwise when you switch databases while they are running
stop will delete volumes for only the most recently used
database.

The fix makes sure that all the db
volumes are defined always so they are always all deleted on stop

84,"Implement support for AutoGPTQ for loading GPTQ quantized models.
This is a quick implementation of PanQiWei /[AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ) for inference.

This is an alternative to the current GPTQ-for-LLaMA hopefully offering a more universally supported option which is not limited to one platform like linux.

AutoGPTQ supports cuda, triton(on linux) and ~cpu~. Splitting using pre_layer is not supported.

#1263 implements another alternative for GPTQ, but due to relying on triton it is not universal. This pr should be compatible with it though as an option.

Right now requires newer than 0.0.5 version of AutoGPTQ in pypi, so build from source is required at the time of writing.

From my testing appears to be slightly slower than GPTQ-for-LLaMA triton branch and slower still with cuda. I have not compared against cuda versions of GPTQ-for-LLaMA. Probably slower than #1263

But AutoGPTQ is seeing rapid development and likely will have better performance while maintaining compatibility and I think this is the main benefit of this implementation.

Please give feedback and testing is appreciated.

85,"Upgrade hatch to fix installing extras bug
### Description

Fix #4107 by updating hatchling  ~~in a fairly hacky way though.~~

Hatch ~~will~~ used to strip out parenthesis in the extras if it thinks it doesn't need them and wouldn't add them back in. ~~:( We can, however, add a meaningless restriction like `and python_version >= '1'` to force hatch to use our parenthesis. Extremely hacky, and I would understand if we don't want this to be merged until a cleaner hatch fix is upstream. Also happy to come up with another way of essentially just having `true` in the spec, but I couldn't find one with a quick reading of https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/.~~

100,"Ensure that manually creating a DAG run doesn't ""block"" the scheduler
It was possible to ""block"" the scheduler such that it would not schedule or queue tasks for a dag if you triggered a DAG run when the DAG was already at the max active runs.

This approach works around the problem for now, but a better longer term fix for this would be to introduce a ""queued"" state for DagRuns, and then when manually creating dag runs (or clearing) set it to queued, and only have the scheduler set DagRuns to running, nothing else -- this would mean we wouldn't need to examine active runs in the TI part of the scheduler loop, only in DagRun creation part.

Fixes #11582.

- Can move around canvas
- Right click by tapping with two fingers

- Can type in conditions
- Double tap to bring search box up

175,"Broaden GPTQ-for-LLaMA branch support
Conditionalized the keyword arguments passed to GPTQ-for-LLaMA's `quant.make_quant()` so we can support more branches simultaneously. Pretty simple, we just test which kwargs `quant.make_quant()` currently has available and don't try to send any invalid ones.

Tested (with varying launch.py arguments) on:
* Oobabooga's old CUDA fork: [9659310499cc7a0ea5498c1beb47bb228d65d178](https://github.com/oobabooga/GPTQ-for-LLaMa/tree/9659310499cc7a0ea5498c1beb47bb228d65d178)
* Current CUDA branch: [610fdae6588c2b17bcf2726cacaaf795cd45077e](https://github.com/qwopqwop200/GPTQ-for-LLaMa/tree/610fdae6588c2b17bcf2726cacaaf795cd45077e)
* Current triton branch: [6800a08c7a3d8d682499df5d6d96666253af8ed1](https://github.com/qwopqwop200/GPTQ-for-LLaMa/tree/6800a08c7a3d8d682499df5d6d96666253af8ed1)

I suspect it would also work with the older non-groupsize versions too, but I don't think I have any old quantizations lying around to test it.

Following up #785

Just to be clear, this still won't make a model quantized by an excessively different version of GPTQ-for-LLaMA load, so e.g. you still need the old CUDA GPTQ-for-LLaMA in your repositories directory to use the 2-week-oldish quantizations most users probably have at this point. Likewise, if you want to try the new triton branch, you'll need to grab some fresh requantizations.
This PR is just so you can use different GPTQ-for-LLaMA versions without having to _also_ fiddle with text-generation-webui code to get things cooperating.", Add import statements for inspect and re modulesAdd import statement for Path from pathlibReplace deprecated torch.nn.init functions with noopAdd make_quant function call with updated argumentsAdd print statement for loading modelChange strict parameter of model.load_state_dict to FalseSet model.seqlen to 2048

185,"Create model card for asafaya/bert-large-arabic
"," ### Description of Pull Request:This pull request introduces a pretrained Arabic BERT Large language model, specifically designed for Arabic. The model is trained on a diverse corpus consisting of approximately 8.2 billion words, including the Arabic version of OSCAR, filtered content from Common Crawl, recent Arabic Wikipedia dumps, and other Arabic resources totaling around 95GB of text.The training data contains some non-Arabic words within sentences, which were not removed to maintain the effectiveness of certain tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER). The corpus and vocabulary set also encompass both Modern Standard Arabic and some dialectical Arabic.The model was trained using Google BERT's GitHub repository on a single TPU v3-8 provided for free by TFRC. The training process involved 3 million training steps with a batch size of 128, as opposed to the original 1 million steps with a batch size of 256.To utilize this model, users can install the `torch` or `tensorflow` library and the Huggingface `transformers` library. The model can be loaded using the following code:```pythonfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModeltokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""asafaya/bert-large-arabic"")model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(""asafaya/bert-large-arabic"")```For more information on the model's performance or any other inquiries, users are encouraged to refer to the Arabic-BERT repository (https://github.com/alisafaya/Arabic-BERT).The development of this pull request is made possible by Google's provision of free TPU for the training process and Huggingface's hosting of the model on their servers."

<!--
1.  üîí - This emoji represents the improved handling of authentication and access rights, as the extractor now checks for the presence and validity of an access token before making requests to the API, and gracefully handles errors related to expired or revoked tokens, insufficient permissions, or missing content.
2.  üåê - This emoji represents the added support for alternative endpoints that provide previews of the posts for anonymous or unauthorized users, as the extractor now falls back to these endpoints when the access token is missing or invalid, or when the post is not accessible to the authenticated user. These endpoints are also used to extract some metadata that is not available from the main API, such as the number of comments and likes on a post.
3.  üõ†Ô∏è - This emoji represents the general refactoring and improvement of the code quality and readability, as the extractor now uses more consistent and descriptive variable names, follows the PEP 8 style guide, and uses helper functions and classes to avoid repetition and complexity.

## üõ†Ô∏è PR Summary

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/actions)

### üåü Summary
Optimization of Non-Max Suppression (NMS) in YOLOv5 object detection.

### üìä Key Changes
- Simplified the sorting of detection boxes based on confidence score.
- Removed excess boxes beyond a maximum threshold (`max_nms`) in one line of code.

### üéØ Purpose & Impact
- **Purpose:** To streamline the box sorting process within NMS and improve code readability.
- **Impact:** This change can potentially speed up the NMS step in object detection, leading to faster inference times. It also makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain for developers. Users can expect slightly quicker results without compromising accuracy when detecting objects in images. üöÄ"," Apply non-maximum suppression to limit the number of boxes to max_nms, and remove excess boxes if necessary, while sorting them by confidence and considering class information."
214,"CVE-2007-4559 Patch
# Patching CVE-2007-4559

Hi, we are security researchers from the Advanced Research Center at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com). We have began a campaign to patch a widespread bug named CVE-2007-4559. CVE-2007-4559 is a 15 year old bug in the Python tarfile package. By using extract() or extractall() on a tarfile object without sanitizing input, a maliciously crafted .tar file could perform a directory path traversal attack. We found at least one unsantized extractall() in your codebase and are providing a patch for you via pull request. The patch essentially checks to see if all tarfile members will be extracted safely and throws an exception otherwise. We encourage you to use this patch or your own solution to secure against CVE-2007-4559. Further technical information about the vulnerability can be found in this [blog](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html).

If you have further questions you may contact us through this projects lead researcher [Kasimir Schulz](mailto:kasimir.schulz@trellix.com).
"," The pull request updates the `tarfile.py` file in the `python3` directory. It adds a new `safe_extract` function to handle tar files, which includes a check for path traversal attempts. The `is_within_directory` function is introduced to verify that the extracted files are within the specified directory, enhancing security. The original `extractall` method is replaced with `safe_extract`, and the path traversal check is applied before extraction."

220,"[runtime env] Parse local conda/pip requirements files before sending runtime env to Ray Client Server




## Why are these changes needed?
Validate the runtime env before sending it to the Ray Client Server.  Validation rewrites the `pip` or `conda` field if it contains a local path to a requirements file, replacing it with a Python object containing the file contents (List in the case of a pip requirements.txt, dict in the case of a conda environment.yml). This prevents errors when the validation is run again on the remote nodes.  

In the future we should refactor jobconfig.py so a validated runtime env is passed in once at the beginning, instead of running validation every time we serialize the JobConfig.

233,"Support inference with OFT networks
## Description

This PR adds support for inference of OFT networks trained with kohya-ss [sd-scripts](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts). The implementation is based on kohya's implementation here: https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/blob/main/networks/oft.py

~~This is a draft PR because of these major issues:~~
* ~~The network remains affects all generations after loading even when supposed to be unloaded~~
* ~~It noticeably slows down inference~~

~~The current implementation replaces sd_module's forward method with a custom forward method, which I believe is the cause of the network continuing to affect future generations and the speed of inference.~~

### ~~Any suggestions on how to fix these issues is greatly appreciated!~~

YOLOv5 LetterBox class for image preprocessing, i.e. T.Compose([T.ToTensor(), LetterBox(size)])

Signed-off-by: Glenn Jocher 

@AyushExel 


## üõ†Ô∏è PR Summary

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/actions)

### üåü Summary
Enhancements to image preprocessing in YOLOv5 with new transformation classes and modified dataloader behavior.

### üìä Key Changes
- üìù Introduced `LetterBox`, `CenterCrop`, and `ToTensor` custom preprocessing classes in `augmentations.py`.
- üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Modified the behavior of default transformations to use new custom classes instead of torchvision transforms.
- üîÑ Updated `dataloaders.py` to incorporate the new transformation classes and streamlined image color conversion when transforms are applied.
- üóÇÔ∏è Cache improvements for storing and retrieving processed images, reducing I/O operations and potentially speeding up training.

### üéØ Purpose & Impact
- üí° **Purpose**: To provide YOLOv5 with more flexible image preprocessing options, specifically tailored to the YOLO architecture, and improve performance through better caching mechanisms.
- üöÄ **Impact**: Expect increased efficiency in data loading, a potential boost in training speed, and easier customization of image preprocessing steps for YOLOv5 users."," Change from albumentations to torchvision transforms- albumentations.Compose([albumentations.ToGray(), albumentations.Resize(224, 224)])+ torchvision.transforms.Compose([torchvision.transforms.Grayscale(num_output_channels=1), torchvision.transforms.Resize(224, 224)])Add torchvision transforms for image preprocessing+ torchvision.transforms.Compose([torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(), torchvision.transforms.Normalize(IMAGENET_MEAN, IMAGENET_STD)])Add CenterCrop and LetterBox transforms+ torchvision.transforms.Compose([torchvision.transforms.CenterCrop(224), torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()])+ torchvision.transforms.Compose([LetterBox(224), torchvision.transforms.ToTensor()])Change ToTensor transforms to half precision+ torchvision.transforms.Compose([torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(), torchvision.transforms.Lambda(lambda x: x.half())])Change transforms in dataloader+ torchvision.transforms.Compose([torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(), torchvision.transforms.Lambda(lambda x: x.half())])"

Specifically, the changes are to reflect change in triton 2.1 that tl.libdevice and triton.testing.allclose are no longer available."," ""Modified gelu function in deepspeed/ops/transformer/inference/triton/gelu.py""The code modification changes the approximation method for the gelu function from using `tl.sigmoid` to using `tl.math.erf`. This change is likely aimed at improving numerical stability or performance. The updated function now uses the mathematical constant `1.41421356237` directly instead of calculating it from `math.sqrt(2)`. The change in the approximation method could potentially affect the precision of the function, which is why the description specifies that it introduces greater approximation errors."

277,"[AIP-49] Completes the Breeze OTel integration and adds a banner to the UI 
Completes the Breeze OpenTelemetry integration and adds a banner to the UI indicating it is currently experimental.

(Final?) PR to add some groundwork to allow OTel support.  Follow-up to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29521 

After getting a working working PoC, the Breeze integration needed a tweak to work correctly.  Changes have been tested against a working* proof-of-concept which can be found [here](https://github.com/ferruzzi/airflow/tree/ferruzzi/otel/poc) for now if anyone wants to try them out.

*So far only a subset of metrics are working in that POC, but the ones that ARE working are working end to end.

Major changes:
- Corrects the OpenTelemetry Collector port to 8889 instead of 8888
- Adds OTel values to the Airflow Config 
- Adds the required new Environment Variables tot he integration's docker-compose file to set those config values 
- If Otel is enabled, adds a banner to the UI showing that OTel support is currently experimental 
- Edits to scripts/ci/docker-compose/otel-collector-config.yml to get it working as expected and trim some fat

Minor Changes:
- Rephrasing some docs
- Cleans up some unnecessary port forwarding in the integration's docker-compose file
- Cleans up some extensions in the OTel collector config file that ended up being unnecessary",

281,"Update profile image on login
Fixes #2196 (not only for discord, but all providers)

Instead of doing the big mess of having to refresh images in the background, we update the images when the user signs in, from the profile we get from the provider.

This has the side effect that if you have 2 different images on 2 different login providers, your image will always change depending on the last provider you logged in with, but I think this is ok.

Also, consolidate all of the updates that are applied to the user to one database call.

307,"Add new option to generate subtitles by a specific number of words
*Updated according jonwook code review

Added a new word option called **--max_words_per_line** that will generate subtitles setting a maximum limit of words per segment. This could sound similar to **--max_line_width** option, but the results are more pleasent for readers IMHO. Here a couple of comparisons using .SRT files:

![max_word_per_line](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/8297398/3ccd320f-8a4d-4502-ba05-4553125d0f71)
Notice that **--max_words_per_line** works as an upper bound of words, but still it will respect the segments in the way that end of sentences can have less words if the remaining number of words in a segment is lower than the **max_words_per_line** value.
i.e. _Segment = [word1, word2, word3, word4, word5] and max_words_per_line = 3
=>Result = [word1, word2, word3] and [word4, word5]_
This is not the behaviour we can see using **--max_line_width** that can leave bigger gaps of time when joining end and beginning of segments:

![comparison](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/8297398/bdd209c0-42bd-4dda-b136-487cde31b76e)

Subtitles generated with **--max_words_per_line** look similar of what we can see in Shorts, Reels and other short duration videos.

This is my first contribution, so feel free of changing/comment/improve anything.

### Additional notes

- The use  of **--max_line_width** will disable the effects of **--max_words_per_line**.
- Manually tested using Python and cli and checked results in .srt and .vtt files (.txt. and .tsv files won't be affected).

When aligning a DataFrame to a Series we are using Series.reindex() to
broadcast the Series data to the new index.  That introduces NaNs when the new
index rows are not identical to the existing ones, which is not the case when
we introduce a new MultiIndex level.

In this patch we use the same approach as for aligning a Series to another
Series. That means that we have to replicate a part of Series._reindex_indexer
as DataFrame does not have it.

311,"Add validation for header name
Following up on #6083, this refactors our header validation function from 2.11.0 to consider the header name. We'd originally avoided adding header name validation because we wanted to limit the change scope to header splitting with new lines. Since then the standard library has made similar changes to ours and now raises a ValueError in `http.client`. This gives us inconsistent errors depending on which portion of the header you provide a bad value.

313,"fix sqs message group visibility when sending messages



## Motivation

Even after the initial implementation of FIFO message groups in #8238, users have reported odd behavior when using SQS FIFO queues related to message group visibility specifically that consumers are triggered although the message group is expected to be invisible #8724. This also affected lambdas triggered with fifo queues #7036.

This PR fixes the mechanism we were using to reset message group visibility, which was too general. It assumed that every message put into the message group reset its visibility, when really it should just be messages that were previously invisible, not new ones.


## Changes

* message group visibility is no longer reset when new messages are sent to the queue

Fixes
* #8724
* #7036 (tested with #7037)

320,"Bisenet-FP - Improved weights for masker
The following pull-request allows for the use of custom trained weights for the Bisenet-FP Mask.

The dataset of 40k faces has been built from a wide variety of posed and in the wild images. These have been manually annotated over several months to handle:
- many varieties of real obstructions
- difficult/varied conditions + poses
- glasses (mask out frames, keep lenses)
- dark sunglasses (mask out frames + lenses)
- multiple targets within a single extracted image.

This dataset will continue to be grown over time and will be used to create new and more improved maskers. Whilst this solution is by no means perfect, it is vastly improved over any existing masking solutions.

NB: This Pull Request does not include the actual weights file. This will be going to Patreons first for a timed exclusive, but the weights will eventually be made available for use in the main code.

## Description

Previously cyclic references were only handled for container and dataclass types, but not namedtuple, attrs, or custom types. This fixes that, and expands the tests to cover these cases.

## Why are these changes needed?

This flaky test checks that it isn't possible to store more objects than the available object store memory, but it looks like it may have been written before object spilling was enabled. Now with spilling and fallback to object allocation on disk, the test should be modified.

## Related issue number

Closes #40446.

They changed ""decryption"" code a little. Here is current one. 

``` js
var y = $(""#yJ7n4OuuU7"").text();
var magic = y.slice(-1).charCodeAt(0);
y = y.split(String.fromCharCode(magic - 1)).join(""  "");
y = y.split(y.slice(-1)).join(String.fromCharCode(magic - 1));
y = y.split(""   "").join(String.fromCharCode(magic));
var s = [];
for (var i = 0; i < y.length; i++) {
  var j = y.charCodeAt(i);
  if ((j >= 33) && (j <= 126)) {
    s[i] = String.fromCharCode(33 + ((j + 14) % 94));
  } else {
    s[i] = String.fromCharCode(j);
  }
}
var tmp = s.join("""");
var str = tmp.substring(0, tmp.length - 1) + String.fromCharCode(tmp.slice(-1).charCodeAt(0) + 2);
```

They've added (funny code if you ask me) 

``` js
var magic = y.slice(-1).charCodeAt(0);
y = y.split(String.fromCharCode(magic - 1)).join(""  "");
y = y.split(y.slice(-1)).join(String.fromCharCode(magic - 1));
y = y.split(""   "").join(String.fromCharCode(magic));
```

I wonder what they are trying to achieve by doing such stupid obfuscation. 

I adopted those changes, let's see how long it will be working this time :)

357,"Fix #6628 - JSONDecodeError are not deserializable
See issue #6628 for full bug-report

-----

requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError are not deserializable: calling `pickle.dumps` followed by `pickle.loads` will trigger an error.

This is particularly a problem in a process pool, as an attempt to decode json on an invalid json document will result in the entire process pool crashing.

This is due to the MRO of the `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` class: the `__reduce__` method called when pickling an instance is not the one from the JSON library parent: two out of three args expected for instantiation will be dropped, and the instance can't be deserialised.

By specifying in the class which parent `__reduce__` method should be called, the bug is fixed as all args are carried over in the resulting pickled bytes."," Update the `exceptions.py` file by adding a `__reduce__` method to the `JSONDecodeError` class, which will allow for proper pickling of the error. Modify the `test_requests.py` file by adding a new test case `test_json_decode_errors_are_serializable_deserializable` to verify the serialization and deserialization of `JSONDecodeError` instances."

## üìö Context

Corrects type annotations and adds some missing annotations.

- What kind of change does this PR introduce?

  - [X] Bugfix
  - [ ] Feature
  - [ ] Refactoring
  - [ ] Other, please describe:

## üß† Description of Changes

- Replace `str` with `Any` where appropriate in input widgets
- Add missing annotations (e.g. `format_func : Callable[[Any], str] = str`)

  - [ ] This is a breaking API change
  - [X] This is a visible (user-facing) change

NOTE: These changes could break user's mypy tests if they rely on the existing annotations (e.g. by using `--strict` and `# type: ignore`).  This is true for basically any changes to type annotations, so IDK if this counts as a ""breaking API change"".

No behavior changes.

## üß™ Testing Done

- [ ] Screenshots included

# Adding a default docker image to ClearML

This PR simply adds some information to the ClearML Task: the default docker image to use. When the task is later cloned and remotely executed, the remote worker (ClearML agent) will use the default YOLOv5 docker image to run the code inside of, which enhanced the out-of-the-box experience of new users.

## Open Question
Currently, I've added `latest` as the docker tag, which is already much better than the nothing we have now, but is there a way we can specifiy the exact correct docker image version tag? Or are you planning on making `latest` always backwards compatible? 

## üõ†Ô∏è PR Summary

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/actions)

### üåü Summary
Improved integration with ClearML by ensuring remote experiments are runnable using a predefined Docker image.

### üìä Key Changes
- Added code to specify a base Docker image (`ultralytics/yolov5:latest`) for remote ClearML tasks.
- Included additional Docker arguments (`--ipc=host -e=""CLEARML_AGENT_SKIP_PYTHON_ENV_INSTALL=1""`) to the task configuration.
- Inserted a script (`pip install clearml`) to set up the Docker environment for ClearML.

### üéØ Purpose & Impact
- üõ† **Enhanced Reproducibility**: Ensures remote tasks run in a consistent environment, reducing discrepancies between local and remote runs.
- üöÄ **Streamlined Set-Up**: Automates the environment setup for ClearML, making it simpler to start remote experiments.
- üìà **Potential Impact**: Benefits users leveraging ClearML for distributed experiments, potentially leading to wider adoption and a smoother experience."," Update the clearml_utils.py file to ensure remote runnability by setting the base Docker image to ""ultralytics/yolov5:latest"" and configuring Docker arguments and setup script. Additionally, implement ClearML Dataset Version retrieval for data with URLs starting with ""clearml://""."

379,"Flip conditional in session.send()
Previously we checked that the `request` being sent was an instance of a
PreparedRequest. If a user somehow created a PreparedRequest using a different
Requests library instance, this check makes the request un-sendable.

(This happened recently - unbeknownst to me, my server was running an outdated
version of pip, vulnerable to this issue - pypa/pip#1489, which creates
multiple subdirectories (src/requests, src/requests/requests) when you rerun
pip install --target. So the PreparedRequest was being created in one version
of the library and compared against the other version of the library, and
throwing this exception, even though they were both PreparedRequest instances!)

It would probably be preferable to check the object's behavior (instead of
its type), but a PreparedRequest has a lot of behavior, and it wouldn't be
really feasible or allow us to provide a helpful error message to check all
of it here. Instead flip the conditional to guard against the user sending an
unprepared Request, which should still give us most of the benefits of the
better error message.

Makes the http downloader much more lenient on what it retries on, to survive any sort of brief network interruption etc. (given enough retries for such). 

We are thinking it is better to retry on more even though some may be unrecoverable, vs retrying on few, known and likely to be recoverable errors but missing many other cases.

403,"Connect AppVeyor to the certbot git repository
Hello !

Since my first PR for cerbot windows compatibility has been merged (see #6296), it is time to industrialize a continuous integration process for windows.

**Principle**

The goal here is to do the same than Travis, but on Windows: to execute all regression tests on various Windows plateform at each push on master, and each push on a PR for master.

This PR and the next are focusing on this:
1) Create a connection to AppVeyor (this PR)
2) Launch as much as possible existing tests on AppVeyor (see adferrand/certbot#8 for a preview).

**About AppVeyor**

First, why AppVeyor ? AppVeyor is really similar to Travis in its approach: it connects to GitHub nicely, configure the build pipeline through a yaml file, allows execution matrix against several environment descriptors (plateform, python version and so on). It is free for GitHub projects, like Travis.

But AppVeyor is built on top of Windows VM clusters, so the build environment is Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows Server 2016. So to sum up, it is the Travis for Windows.

Furthermore, the VMs offers a complete Visual Studio environment, so it is the royal path to build MSI installers of Certbot on Windows platforms.

**About this PR**

Now, this PR does not a lot of things: it declares a ""dummy"" `appveyor.yml` at the root of certbot repository: the built declared cannot fail, it just prints ""Hello World"" before marking the build as succeeded.

What really matters here, is to connect AppVeyor to the certbot github repository, and it is the real work of this PR, that I cannot do obsiously ... 

**The process to connect AppVeyor to GitHub**

The process is really similar to Travis. **It must be done after the current PR is merged to master!** (Otherwise unexpected behavior will occur due to the lack of `appveyor.yml` file on the master branch).

A developper with access to the certbot account need to go to https://www.appveyor.com/, click Sign-In, then select GitHub as the provider to create the account. Once the OAuth authentication is established, AppVeyor will scan for public repositories hold by the certbot GitHub account. From AppVeyor administration page, you will need to go to `Projects`, `New Project`, and select `certbot` in the drop-down list of GitHub category.

Once done, AppVeyor is connected to the certbot project repository. Any PR on master will need by default to pass both Travis CI pipelines and AppVeyor pipelines. As said before, and until my next PR, this will have no impact as the integrated dummy `appveyor.yml` cannot fail.

**Next step**

When this PR is merged and AppVeyor is connected to GitHub, I will create the next PR, that will then toggle the real CI pipeline for Windows that I prepared here: adferrand/certbot#8

**Help**

Of course I am at your disposition for any help needed on this PR and on AppVeyor.

Regards,
Adrien Ferrand"," Description of pull request:This pull request introduces a new AppVeyor CI pipeline configuration for Windows Server 2016/2012 R2. It specifies that the pipeline should only run on the master branch and version branches following the pattern X.X.X. Additionally, it includes a test script that executes a PowerShell command to print ""Hello, world!"" to the console."

405,"Allow runtime modifications of HTTP flow filters for server replays
#### Description
Fixes #4506
`mitmproxy` during server-replay mode, calculates the hashes of flows from input files based on user defined filters and uses them to compare against hashes of incoming requests to serve the corresponding stored response by matching the hash. However, during runtime, if the user changes any of the filters, `mitmproxy` fails to recalculate the hashes of input flows and hence doesn't return the intended response. This PR fixes this issue by recomputing the hashes for every flow whenever a filter(option) used for computing hashes is changed.

407,"fix lambda function URLs when they don't exist or the service is not loaded



## Motivation

I noticed an error when calling non-existing lambda function URLs. The code we had was apparently faulty, and I got this error:

```

                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

After writing a test, I further ran into a problem that we've had in the past, which is that, services that have a data plane are not properly loaded based on calling URLs of the data plane, even though we could.

Previously localstack would behave like this when calling a lambda function URL without lambda being loaded first (e.g., by calling `awslocal lambda list-functions`.

```
 % curl http://a38wes0ubqxh7ipckjdl8ilptt40uiha.lambda-url.us-east-1.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566
{""__type"": ""InternalError"", ""message"": ""exception while calling lambda with unknown operation: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \""/opt/code/localstack/localstack/aws/protocol/parser.py\"", line 557, in parse\n    operation, uri_params = self._operation_router.match(request)\n                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \""/opt/code/localstack/localstack/aws/protocol/op_router.py\"", line 321, in match\n    rule, args = matcher.match(path, method=method, return_rule=True)\n                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \""/opt/code/localstack/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/werkzeug/routing/map.py\"", line 631, in match\n    raise NotFound() from None\nwerkzeug.exceptions.NotFound: 404 Not Found: The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.\n\nThe above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \""/opt/code/localstack/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/rolo/gateway/chain.py\"", line 166, in handle\n    handler(self, self.context, response)\n  File \""/opt/code/localstack/localstack/aws/handlers/service.py\"", line 63, in __call__\n    return self.parse_and_enrich(context)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \""/opt/code/localstack/localstack/aws/handlers/service.py\"", line 67, in parse_and_enrich\n    operation, instance = parser.parse(context.request)\n                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \""/opt/code/localstack/localstack/aws/protocol/parser.py\"", line 172, in wrapper\n    return func(*args, **kwargs)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \""/opt/code/localstack/localstack/aws/protocol/parser.py\"", line 559, in parse\n    raise OperationNotFoundParserError(\nlocalstack.aws.protocol.parser.OperationNotFoundParserError: Unable to find operation for request to service lambda: GET /\n""}%  
```

In this situation:
* the service is identified as ""lambda"" because of the hostname matching rule (`.lambda-url.`)
* the service hasn't been loaded yet, so the edge routes for lambda (i.e., the data plane) haven't been added yet either
* therefore, the request moves on to the service request parser, which fails because no operation is associated with the request.

bad and ugly!

instead, localstack now correctly loads the lambda service:

```
curl http://a38wes0ubqxh7ipckjdl8ilptt40uiha.lambda-url.us-east-1.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566
{""Message"": null}
```

I had to
* adapt the service loader so it correctly loads services even when there is no api operation set (for the life of me i cannot remember why i thought it would be useful to check individual operations rather than just whole services).
* add a special type of service loader that only checks the hostname rules



## Changes

* A selected set of services are now properly loaded when calling data plane URLs. Specfically, URLs of APIGW (`.execute-api.`), S3 website (`.s3-website.`) (cc @bentsku) and lambda (`.lambda-url.`)
* Calling non-existing lambda function URLs now returns the correct HTTP response

431,"Add support for Pinterest, as a showcase of using VideoExtractor
As requested in #744.

At this point, the usage of `VideoExtractor` was limited on just a few sites: **YouTube**, **Youku**, and **IQiyi**. All of them are non-trivial to implement; and relevant code is hard to read. As I understood, this has been a major obstacle for starters who wish to implement new extractors using `VideoExtractor`.

I implemented the code for extracting images from **Pinterest**, as a showcase of using `VideoExtractor` - it's all in some 50 lines of code, well commented and easy to make sense for anyone (hopefully).

It seems I'm unlikely to refactor this part for at least a while. So, you may use [`pinterest.py`](https://github.com/soimort/you-get/blob/f44a99536680c3d6529a28cf0f10ce09f2f86279/src/you_get/extractors/pinterest.py) here in this PR as a minimal boilerplate of implementing your own `VideoExtractor` instance.

I decided to make a fork using the formatting code from a previous commit in order to restore the more detailed file names. Most of my changes are put into one function that works similarly to `save_persistent_history`. 
I briefly tested the code in Chat and Instruct mode on Windows."," Update save_history function to save_history_at_user_request, adding a new function to generate timestamped file paths and modifying the download_button click event to use the updated save_history_at_user_request function. Additionally, the character_menu and mode are now passed as arguments to the save_history_at_user_request function. The file_deleter event is removed. The upload_json event now has interactive and non-interactive options. The Submit character event now calls upload_character and character_menu events. The Submit character event also has clear options for interactive and non-interactive modes. The shared object is updated to include gradio."

466,"Fix figsize issue when using matplotlib locally
This is a pretty minor issue, but I'm seeing the following when passing `figsize=(20,10)` when plotting a Series in the `ipython --pylab` environment:

![Series_figsize](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/440095/267751/46f8b184-8ebd-11e2-8631-2131ce0421f6.png)

Everything's there - the window is just initialized to the wrong size. Without the `--pylab` flag and manually calling `plt.show()`, the window shows up as the default size (which is incorrect).

The issue appears to be that `plot_series()` will call `plt.gca()` before `figsize=` has been passed to `plt.figure()`. This initializes the window to the default size and it apparently isn't updated when redrawn.

What this patch does is use `plt.get_fignums()` to see if we have any existing figures. If so, we can call `plt.gca()` without automatically creating a figure and window at the default sizes.

The addition of `new_ax.right_axis = new_ax` is to accommodate Series plotted with `secondary_y=True` and thus getting `new_ax` as their `Axes`. It renders fine without it but a few tests expect `right_axis` to exist. This could be handled differently if this is inappropriate.

Finally, there's a test to check that `figsize=` is at least implemented on the figure. I don't know of a way to test this bug in a backend-independent way, so this only checks that we're not regressing to the pre-v0.10.0 state where `figsize=` was silently ignored by `plot_series()`.
"," Change the figsize parameter to set the figure size to (16, 8) and add a right y-axis with customized title and size settings."

"," Description of pull request:- Added `RecordVideo` and `TimeLimit` wrappers to the Gym library.- `RecordVideo` is a lightweight wrapper that helps recording videos.

It supports two modes of video recording: episodic and fixed-interval.- `TimeLimit` is a wrapper that limits the maximum number of steps per episode.- Both wrappers have been deprecated in favor of `gym.wrappers.RecordVideo` and `gym.wrappers.RecordEpisodeStatistics`.- Both wrappers require review for good assertion messages and test coverage."

488,"[Windows] Create an installer for Certbot
This PR is the first step to create an official distribution channel of Certbot for Windows. It consists essentially in creating a proper Certbot Windows installer.

Usually distributing an application requires, in a way or another, to stabilize the application logic and its dependencies around a given version. On Windows, this usually takes the form of a freezed application, that vendors its dependencies into a single executable.

There are two well-known solutions to create an executable shipping a Python application on Windows: [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/) and [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/). However these solutions create self-executable `.EXE` files: you run the `.EXE` file that launches immediately the software.

This is not a end-user solution. Indeed when a Windows user wants to install a piece of software, he expects to find and download an installer. When run the installer would interface with Windows to setup configuration entries in the Registry, update the environment variable, add shortcuts in the Start Menu, and declare a uninstaller entry into the Uninstaller Manager. Quite similarly, this is what you would get from a `.deb` or `.rpm` package.

A solution that builds proper installers is [pynsis](https://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is a Python project that constructs installers for Python software using [NSIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/), the most known free Windows installer builder solution.

This PR uses pynsist to build a Windows installer. The Powershell script to launch the installer build is `.\windows-installer\construct.ps1`. Once finished, the installer is located at `.\windows-installer\build\nsis\certbot-[CERTBOT_VERSION]-win32_install.exe`.

This installer will do the following operations during the installation:
* copy in the install path a full python distribution used exclusively for Certbot
* copy all Python requirements gathered from the `setup.py` of relevant certbot projects
* copy `certbot`, `acme` and all dns plugins packages
* pre-build python binary assets
* create a shortcut on the start menu to open the online Certbot documentation
* register the existence of the application correctly in Windows Registry
* prepare a procedure to uninstall Certbot
* and of course, expose `certbot` executable to the Windows command line, like on Linux, to be able to launch it as any CLI application from Batch or Powershell

This installer support updates: downloading a new version of it and running it on a Windows with existing installation of Certbot will replace it with the new version.

Future capabilities not included in this PR:
* auto-update of Certbot when a new release is available
* online documentation for Windows (that should be the target 
for the created shortcut in Start Menu)
* register a scheduled task for certificate renewal
* installer distribution (continuous deployment + distribution channels)
* method to check the downloaded installer is untampered"," This pull request describes changes made to the `windows-installer/run.bat` file. The changes include adding a new line at the beginning of the file to echo a message, checking for administrative privileges, and prompting the user for administrative access if necessary. Additionally, the file now contains a command to run 'certbot' commands in the Windows installer environment.Summary of changes:- Added a new line at the beginning of the `run.bat` file to display a message.- Checked for administrative privileges and prompted the user for access if not already granted.- Included a command to run 'certbot' commands in the Windows installer environment.This pull request does not seem to modify any other files or directories. However, it does require administrative privileges to run successfully. The changes are related to the Windows installer environment and the integration of the Certbot tool.

Support `clips` category in HotStar extractor. Update `yt_dlp/extractor/hotstar.py` to handle `clips` URLs and extract metadata from `content` API endpoint.

> _We're the extractors of the night_
> _We rip the clips from HotStar's site_
> _We update our regex to catch them all_
> _We map them to the content and we make them fall_

### Walkthrough
*  Update regex for matching HotStar video URLs to include `clips` category ([link](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/7710/files?diff=unified&w=0#diff-0a6703759f63eb9f8d2a82b989320bcfddf8e3cd634bbc3b4e4c10e643f6ed9eL87-R87))
*  Add new key-value pair to `_FEED_TYPES` dictionary to map `clips` type to `content` endpoint ([link](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/7710/files?diff=unified&w=0#diff-0a6703759f63eb9f8d2a82b989320bcfddf8e3cd634bbc3b4e4c10e643f6ed9eR175))
*  Add test case for a video from the `clips` category with expected metadata and format information ([link](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/7710/files?diff=unified&w=0#diff-0a6703759f63eb9f8d2a82b989320bcfddf8e3cd634bbc3b4e4c10e643f6ed9eR146-R157))

Currently, in ComfyUI-Manager, automatic installation of dependencies is performed when installing custom nodes. However, this can lead to module conflicts or failure to install due to file locking issues, especially in Windows environments.

To address this problem, a solution has been implemented where the imports are minimized at the top of main.py, allowing the install script to run in an environment with minimal imports."," This pull request introduces changes to the `main.py` file, including the addition of a new import statement for `os`, `importlib.util`, and `folder_paths`. It also modifies the `main` function by adding a new function `execute_prestartup_script` that executes startup scripts for custom nodes. The `main` function now imports `asyncio`, `itertools`, and `yaml`, and imports `execution` and `server` from their respective modules.

# Description
Modifies the `load_data` method of the Discord Reader class with an additional optional parameter to return complete message metadata, namely by way of a boolean value `complete_metadata` (defaulted to false). 

This change is needed for users who wish to query information about the users and allows for further advanced filtering (such as NSFW content, among others). This change requires no dependency changes.

"," In the pull request, changes are made to the `transformers/modeling_rag.py` file within the `src/transformers` directory. The modifications involve the `forward` method, where the generation process is updated to directly generate from the retrieved documents instead of the input IDs. Additionally, the `generate` method is modified to handle batch processing of documents, dividing the batch size by the number of documents per batch. The code also includes conditional logic to handle cases where the retriever is not used."

## Description

Follow-up to https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/pull/12514, more significant VRAM reduction. For a batch size of 4 with hires fix (512x512 -> 1024x1024) this cut off around 2GB of VRAM for me. For a **single** 512x512 @ hr = 2 image (not part of a batch), it cut off around 750MB, and 512x768 @ hr = 2 a bit over 1GB.
This was being done [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/blob/da80d649fd6a6083be02aca5695367bd25abf0d5/modules/processing.py#L1105-L1108) but it can be performed even earlier and should be since decoding the latents is pretty heavy.

~~I hadn't tested this with SDXL yet, not sure if this causes any issue for the refiner. I'm assuming it doesn't but I haven't taken the time to review how that's implemented yet. Probably will reduce VRAM usage for SDXL in general though too if this works as I expect.~~ Occurred to me this is not related to SDXL code at all, so this doesn't affect it.

## Description

Another small contribution to #37 . I am not so sure about the last two tests, because I couldn't exactly pinpoint what the traceback is supposed to do in those cases. 

Also: I added a `no cover` statement. I noticed that when I add a print statement before the `break`, both the `break` and the print are reached according to coverage (which makes sense).

553,"Add support for specifying (persistent) id for SVG exports
As part of Airflow's CI we save SVG images of our command's help output and commit them to git.

## üõ†Ô∏è PR Summary

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/actions)

### üåü Summary
Improved metadata handling for OpenVINO exports and model class name loading in YOLOv5.

### üìä Key Changes
- üîß Added `yaml` import for metadata handling.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Modified `export_openvino` function to include the model parameter.
- ‚ú® OpenVINO export now saves a `meta.yaml` file with model stride and class names.
- üîç The `__init__` method in `models/common.py` no longer loads class names from `data.yaml` directly.
- üì¶ New `_load_metadata` method in `MultiBackend` class to load metadata from `meta.yaml`.
- üõ†Ô∏è Refactored code related to warmup to ensure GPU model warmup.

### üéØ Purpose & Impact
- üîÑ The changes allow for better integration and metadata management when exporting models to OpenVINO format, enabling users to retain important information about the model such as stride and class names.
- üß† This improves the ease of use and compatibility of YOLOv5 models with the OpenVINO toolkit, potentially broadening the user base involved in deploying YOLOv5 on different platforms.
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Warmup refactoring ensures that the models are correctly primed for inference, particularly on GPU devices, leading to more efficient operations post-deployment.", Change model type from PyTorch to TensorRT and warmup the model- Remove the warmup code for PyTorch models+ Change the model type from PyTorch to TensorRT+ Add warmup code for TensorRT modelsChange model file path from 'path/to/model.pt' to 'path/to/model.trt'- Remove the model file path 'path/to/model.pt'+ Change the model file path from 'path/to/model.pt' to 'path/to/model.trt'

## üõ†Ô∏è PR Summary

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/actions)

### üåü Summary
Refactored `detect.py` for readability and default argument setup.

### üìä Key Changes
- üîß Changed `detect` function parameters to have default values, streamlining command-line argument parsing.
- üßπ Cleaned up the argument processing to use function arguments directly, instead of an `opt` object.
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Removed conditional update logic from main execution block to a more appropriate location within the `detect` function.

### üéØ Purpose & Impact
- üìà **Enhanced Readability**: The refactor makes the code easier to read and understand, improving maintainability.
- üõ† **Default Function Parameters**: Users can now call `detect` with or without specific arguments, facilitating easier integration as a module.
- üß© **Modularity**: Direct use of arguments in the `detect` function makes it more self-contained and modular, benefiting users who import it as a library.
- üîÑ **Smoother Updates**: Integrating the update check into the `detect` function simplifies the main code structure and helps in keeping models up-to-date seamlessly.",

615,"Add support for QLoRA
## Why are these changes needed?
This PR supports [QLoRA ](https://github.com/artidoro/qlora)which is a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that loads the model backbone method in 4bit. This will lead to a 13B model taking about 10GB and a 7B model taking about 5GB of memory. One can train in the same way as before except add an argument `--q_lora True` to your CLI command.

Notes about implementation:
- Had to comment out `torch_dtype` in `apply_lora` to make merging the base model with Lora weights work. [Reference to Solution](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/497)
- **Deepspeed3 Incompatibility:** I believe that DeepSpeed3 does not work with QLoRA, since it isn't possible to load the model in a mixed-int format while using stage 3, but I could be wrong. I added a warning to the code for that. [Reference](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/8f093fb799246f7dd9104ff44728da0c53a9f67a/src/transformers/modeling_utils.py#L2226-L2229). I also tried to train without explicitly naming a device map such as `device_map = None` but that led to tensors being on different devices error.
- **FSDP Incompatability**: Running the finetuning using FSDP will lead to an error: ""ValueError: `FlatParameter` requires uniform `requires_grad`"", which is due to how FSDP is constructed in the current pytorch-stable build. However, the nightly version does support it if we set `use_orig_params=True` as reported [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/100945), but the memory savings may not be high.

652,"Add support for different TFDS `BuilderConfig`s
As of now a user can't use a TFDS `BuilderConfig` different than the default one: the current parser assumes that the dataset is in the form `{torch,tfds,...}/dataset`, while in the case of TFDS datasets it can be `tfds/dataset/builder-type`, e.g. `tfds/diabetic_retinopathy_detection/btgraham-300` (as in [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/diabetic_retinopathy_detection#diabetic_retinopathy_detectionbtgraham-300)).

This PR fixes this by taking whatever is split at line 10 after the first element (which is the source of the dataset) and joining it again with `/`.

In the case there is just one `/`, then `name[1:]` will contain just one element, e.g., if we pass `tfds/imagenet2012`, then `name[1:] == [""imagenet2012""]` and `""/"".join(name[1:]) == ""imagenet2012""`, leaving the current behavior unchanged. If instead there are multiple `/` (e.g. `""tfds/diabetic_retinopathy_detection/btgraham-300""`), then `name[1:] == [""diabetic_retinopathy_detection"", ""btgraham-300""]`, and `""/"".join(name[1:]) == ""diabetic_retinopathy_detection/btgraham-300""`, which is compatible with the `tfds` format."," Update parser creation logic to use a slash-separated name instead of the last element of the name list, improving flexibility for parser selection."

662,"Avoid deadlock for unsynchronized non-zero checkpointing
For non-ZeRO checkpointing, we should not synchronize all ranks at checkpoint. This way we avoid deadlocks."," The provided code snippet is a part of a larger codebase that deals with saving model checkpoints in a distributed setting, specifically using PyTorch and DeepSpeed. The changes made in the code are related to handling checkpoints in a zero-stage 2 (ZeRO) setup, which is a method to handle large models by partitioning the model across multiple devices and using gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes.Here's a summary of the changes made:1. The code has been updated to handle both non-zero and zero checkpoints. Non-zero checkpoints are used for saving the model state, while zero checkpoints are used for saving the optimizer state.2. The `_create_checkpoint_file` and `_save_checkpoint` methods have been updated to handle zero checkpoints.3. The `_save_zero_checkpoint` method has been added to save the optimizer state in a zero checkpoint file.4. The code now uses the `FP16DeepspeedZeroOptimizer` class instead of the `DeepspeedZeroOptimizer` class for zero-stage 2 optimizer.The changes made in the code are related to the following aspects:- Handling checkpoints in a zero-stage 2 setup: The code now handles both non-zero and zero checkpoints, which are essential for saving the model state and optimizer state in a ZeRO setup.- Using FP16DeepspeedZeroOptimizer: The code now uses the `FP16DeepspeedZeroOptimizer` class instead of the `DeepspeedZeroOptimizer` class for zero-stage 2 optimizer. This change is necessary because ZeRO and FP16 are not compatible with Adam optimizer, and using FP16 optimizer allows for compatibility with ZeRO.- Gradient accumulation: The code now uses gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes, which is a key feature of ZeRO.Overall, the changes made in the code are related to handling checkpoints in a zero-stage 2 setup, using FP16 optimizer, and gradient accumulation. These changes are essential for saving and loading large models efficiently in a distributed setting."

666,"Numeric Password Cracker
Description:
**The Numeric Password Cracker is a memory-efficient Python script designed to find numeric passwords using permutation generation. The program utilizes generators from the itertools library, which allows it to generate password permutations on-the-fly without storing them in memory. This approach significantly reduces memory consumption, making the script efficient even for large password lengths.**

**_Advantages and Positive Points:_**
1. Memory-Efficient: By using generators, the program generates password permutations on-the-fly, minimizing memory usage. This enables it to handle long password lengths without excessive memory consumption.
2. Fast Execution: The memory-efficient design also contributes to faster execution times, as the program does not need to store and manage large datasets in memory.
3. Scalability: Due to its memory efficiency, the Numeric Password Cracker can efficiently process a wide range of password lengths, accommodating various use cases.
4. Versatility: Users can easily customize the maximum password length to be checked, allowing the program to adapt to different target passwords.
5. Non-Destructive: The script operates in a read-only manner, making it non-destructive and safe to use in testing and educational scenarios.
6. Open-Source: As an open-source tool, the Numeric Password Cracker encourages collaboration, code review, and contributions from the developer community.
7. Educational Value: The program serves as an educational resource for password security, algorithms, and Python's generator concept.
8. Ethical Approach: The script emphasizes responsible and ethical use, discouraging any illegal or unauthorized activities.

Note: While the Numeric Password Cracker is efficient and useful for legitimate purposes such as educational learning and security assessments, it must never be used for illegal or unauthorized activities. Always ensure proper authorization before attempting to crack passwords or access systems."," Change the numeric_password_cracker.py file by adding a new function to generate numeric password permutations, updating the password_cracker function to use this generator, and modifying the main execution block to attempt cracking a specific target password.Changes include:- Implementation of a function `generate_password_permutations` that generates all possible numeric password permutations of a given length using itertools.product.- Modification of the `password_cracker` function to iterate over generated permutations up to a specified maximum length, attempting to match the target password.- A main execution block that defines a target password, attempts to crack it using the updated `password_cracker` function, and prints the result."

670,"Issue 9401 - SequentialChain runs the same callbacks over and over in async mode
Issue: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/9401

In the Async mode, SequentialChain implementation seems to run the same callbacks over and over since it is re-using the same callbacks object.

Langchain version: 0.0.264, master

The implementation of this aysnc route differs from the sync route and sync approach follows the right pattern of generating a new callbacks object instead of re-using the old one and thus avoiding the cascading run of callbacks at each step.

Async mode:
```
        _run_manager = run_manager or AsyncCallbackManagerForChainRun.get_noop_manager()
        callbacks = _run_manager.get_child()
        ...
        for i, chain in enumerate(self.chains):
            _input = await chain.arun(_input, callbacks=callbacks)
            ...
```

Regular mode:
```
        _run_manager = run_manager or CallbackManagerForChainRun.get_noop_manager()
        for i, chain in enumerate(self.chains):
            _input = chain.run(_input, callbacks=_run_manager.get_child(f""step_{i+1}""))
            ...
```

Notice how we are reusing the callbacks object in the Async code which will have a cascading effect as we run through the chain. It runs the same callbacks over and over resulting in issues.

Solution:
Define the async function in the same pattern as the regular one and added tests.

## üìö Context

This is another change that's being made because we need it for the `feature/session-manager` branch
but is being made straight to `develop` to keep the final diff size down.

The special test-only `closeConnection` proto message type has a pretty misleading name because what
it really does is shut down the runtime entirely. Because we need a way to test reconnect behavior (and thus
a way to close *only* the browser websocket connection without nuking the entire Streamlit server), we replace
this proto type with `debugShutdownRuntime` and `debugDisconnectWebsocket`, which do what their names
suggest.

the python executable on macOS.  As of macOS 10.14.4, the previous
code causes a hard failure when running tests, although similar
failures had been seen under some conditions under some earlier
systems.  Reverting the change to the interpreter stack size at link
time helped for release builds but caused some tests to fail when
built --with-pydebug.  Try the opposite approach: continue to build
the interpreter with an increased stack size on macOS and remove
the failing setrlimit call in regrtest initialization.  This will
definitely avoid the resource.RLIMIT_STACK error and should have
no, or fewer, side effects.

Users who updated to `gradio==4.26.0` have reported that the `whisper_stt` extension has stopped working.

Oh my eyes my eyes
I'm blinded by the Light

## Description
https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/commit/682ff8936df018330e0d2a259794a262dc3251b2 I know you're overjoyed
but at least make it consistent and configurable

the default brush color for the color sketch is not important, as we have a `color picker` built into the tool
but since you changed it on `Inpaint sketch` and not for `sketch` I decide to annoy you to put all three options in
> and set the default color black to annoy you, change it to white if you want

unfortunately I don't think there is a `color picker` on the noirmal `sketch` tool (only on the `color-sketch`)
so we cannot change the mask brush color during use
and the mask color is not updated by the settings immediately and requires a Reload
maybe it's achievable if we do some messing around with JavaScript

able to change the transparent mask color is important
as depending on what images you're working on some mask color may not be suited

  - [ ] Bugfix
  - [ ] Feature
  - [ ] Refactoring
  - [x] Other, please describe:

This PR is related to [Issue-#4923](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4923). It makes `st.write` to serialize `set` as `list` instead of `string`, so the user can benefit on existing collapse mechanism when browsing the data.

## üß† Description of Changes

- _Add bullet points summarizing your changes here_

  - [ ] This is a breaking API change
  - [ ] This is a visible (user-facing) change

**Revised:**

_Insert screenshot of your updated UI/code here_

**Current:**

Currently `set` is serialized to string, when using `st.write`, like this:

```
{
  ""list"": [],
  ""set"": ""set()"",
  ""dict"": {}
}
```
I'd like to render them as `list`, so we can benefit on existing `st.json` collapse mechanism when browsing the data.

825,"[generation] consistently add eos tokens
Currently beam search returns inconsistent outputs - if hypos have different lengths we get eos, if they are the same - we don't. I found a sentence where if I change one letter in one of the input words the beam search outputs all suddenly lack eos, which is an inconsistent behavior.

This PR makes the output more consistent. (but not 100%, please see below)

---------


Also why not replace:

```
            if sent_lengths[i] < max_length:
                decoded[i, sent_lengths[i]] = eos_token_id
```
with:
```
            decoded[i, sent_lengths[i]] = eos_token_id
```
Shouldn't eos always be there? If generated data gets truncated, the caller needs to use a larger `max_length`.

Currently, if the hypos lengths are on the cusp of `max_length`, some of them will get eos, whereas others won't, which is again inconsistent.

Please correct me if my logic is flawed.

-----

I also looked at `_generate_no_beam_search` - there eos adding logic uses a somewhat different logic. 

Should the two functions (beam/no_beam) be consistent eos-injection wise?

"," Modification of the generation_utils.py file in the transformers package:- Removal of the shorter batch padding logic, replaced with a new approach to handle shorter batches and eos_token_id.- Assertion added to ensure pad_token_id is defined.- Replacement of the previous logic for filling decoded with hypotheses and eos_token_id with a new loop that fills the decoded tensor with hypotheses and eos_token_id if the latter fits in."

833,"[Whisper] Move decoder id method to tokenizer
# What does this PR do?

Moves the method `get_decoder_prompt_ids` from the processor to the tokenizer. The primary reason for this change is that the ASR pipeline class does not load the processor object, but rather the feature extractor and tokenizer separately (see [docs](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/699e90437f984d69ad3c9b891dd2e9d0fc2cffe4/src/transformers/pipelines/automatic_speech_recognition.py#L123)). Therefore, as things currently stand, pipeline does not have access to the processor method `get_decoder_prompt_ids`. By moving it to the tokenizer, it will be able to call this method with pipeline.

Note that this is not a breaking change: we retain a method `get_decoder_prompt_ids` in the processor. This method simply calls the `get_decoder_prompt_ids` from the tokenizer:

862,"Build certbot snap without the isolation build
Fixes #8252

With @bmw we digged quite a lot on why the failure happens on ARM snap, and here we what we understood:
* the failure occurs since the version 50 of setuptools is available
* normally, we should not be impacted because the setuptools version used in the snap build should be the one installed by the `core20` base snap, because the build occurs in a `venv` created with `--system-site-packages`
* BUT associated with the build isolation provided by recent versions of pip (to implement PEP 517), a bad interaction happens: following the definition of the build system provided by `cryptography`, pip installs the most recent version of setuptools on a separate path for the build (because `cryptography` just asks for a minimal version of `setuptools`), then features of this version conflict with the old version of `setuptools` initially present
* the exact interaction is described here: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6264#issuecomment-685230919. Basically the new version of `setuptools` triggers some hacks, that are then applied at runtime on the old version of `setuptools` that is also still available in `sys.path` at this point, and breaks the build.

To fix that, one can disable the isolation build on cryptography, by passing `PIP_NO_ISOLATION_BUILD=no` to pip. It is the purpose of this PR.

This will have the consequence to not be PEP 517 compliant: if needed the `cryptography` library will be built using the `setuptools` available in the system. In general I think it makes sense for the snap build purpose, since we control precisely the build environment, and makes consistent build that will not be broken by a new version of a build system if library maintainers did not provide a strict version of it in their build requirements. However we need now to take care about having a compatible build system for all libraries that may have specific requirements in their build system using the PEP 517 definition in `pyproject.toml`.

I think as of now that it is a safe move if we keep using the most recent version of `setuptools` available in Ubuntu 20.04, and it is the case here for snap builds. It may however be problematic if some libraries require another build system than `setuptools` and do not provide a fallback to a `setuptools` build. For the record, `dns-lexicon`, that I maintain, uses `poetry` and so a PEP 517 compliant definition of a build system, but provides also this fallback (https://github.com/AnalogJ/lexicon/blob/master/setup.py).

869,"improve docker image size
# Description

Improves the docker image size. Summary of various changes

* Added `--no-install-recommends`, newlined install items and removed the apt list and cache as per [best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#run) 
* Merged the `mujoco` RUN directive with the `apt` RUN directive to reduce layers
* Added `--no-cache-dir` to the `pip` installs since the pip cache isn't needed for a docker image
* `mujoco` is now downloaded and piped to tar to location, previously it the `mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` was left in the docker image when it wasn't needed
* Added `SHELL [""/bin/bash"", ""-o"", ""pipefail"", ""-c""]` for safety
* Added quotes around various strings to ensure splitting doesn't occur

Followed rules from [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) and [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)


Running `docker build -t gym-orig --build-arg=PYTHON_VERSION=3 -f py.Dockerfile . --no-cache` with the original `Dockerfile`, the size (compressed) came out to 1.61GB and the same command with the `gym-new` tag it comes down to `1.45GB` compressed

```bash
$ docker images | grep gym
gym-new                                                                      latest          ab7f651f39f3   17 seconds ago   1.45GB

879,"Optimized numpy functions in Converter
This PR optimized the conversion speed.
This is done mainly by choosing more performant variants for the numpy processing in the `Converter` class.

The Converter now also gets whole batches from the `Predict.queue_out_frames` method. This was mainly done to enable batch processing and potential replacing numpy functions with keras ones later on, but it also increased my speed by about 3it/s.

Optimizing the worker Plugins remains to be done. They did not take enough time in my setup to be really relevant. This may be different with other settings.

Benchmarks:
- Current staging: 16.45 it/s
- This PR WITHOUT providing whole batches to the converter: 21.40 it/s
- This PR as is: 24.69 it/s

"," Change: Value of c from 3 to 4Description: Change the value of c from 3 to 4 in the code. This change is likely related to the handling of the alpha channel in the image processing. The alpha channel is used to represent the transparency of the image, and changing its value might affect the final output of the image processing.The specific line of code where this change occurs is:```pythonnew_face = np.concatenate((new_face, mask), -1)```This line of code concatenates the new_face and mask arrays along the last axis (-1), which is where the alpha channel is located. By changing the value of c from 3 to 4, it seems that the code is now handling an additional channel for the alpha channel, which might be used for more complex transparency effects."

You can find more details about the troubleshooting and reasoning in #8355.

906,"Merge output format
As explained in https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/3610, https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/issues/2765 there are cases when downloading separate video and audio and then merging when the video container (usually webm containing VP8/VP9) is incompatible with the audio codec (aac/mp3). By default, youtube-dl attempts to create a merge in the container format of the video file.

This is a redo of pull request https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/pull/4577. This time around I've added a video option called ""merge-ouput-format"" that specifies what container format the merge output should be put into. It is only used if merging is required (something like ""-f best"" will not use it for instance). If you provide nothing for it, the video part's container format will be used, just like before.

958,"Allow Peft models to share their base model




## Why are these changes needed?

This adds a special environment variable that activates shared Peft model base weights.  Currently when loading two Peft models that have the same base model, those model weights are loaded once.  With this flag activated, all Peft models will share the same base model.

To make this work it requires a few work around due to how Huggingface's Peft model has implemented LoRA adapters, the most popular variant.  These modify the base model's pytorch modules directly and thus adapters sharing the same base model must live within the same model object and a `set_adapter` method must be called to switch between them.

961,"Fix amcrest detection of sensor reset
## Proposed change
Previous versions of pyamcrest passed a boolean to home assistant
depending on whether the event was the activation of a sensor or not.
This was used by the amcrest integration to decide the state of the
binary sensors.

The latest pyamcrest passes through a non-empty payload dictionary
instead, which is a true-value and the binary sensor would always
be deemed active.

Look into the payload for an ""action"": ""start"" item instead.

This allows sortish sampler logic to work on multiple GPU.

2) reorder those using the `SortishSampler` logic.

### Results 
The results on a small MT task are similar to the 1 GPU setting. 
+ 2 GPU, random sampler: 13 mins/epoch  BLEU 8.6
+ 2 GPU, `DistributedSortishSampler`: 10 mins/epoch, BLEU 8.6

[Oracle Linux Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Linux) is a [clone of CentOS/RHEL](https://www.oracle.com/linux/index.html). The Certbot Apache plugin cannot auto-detect the Oracle Linux Apache setup, causing a generic (but incorrect) Apache Linux configuration to be used, which emits this error:

> The apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.
> The error was: NoInstallationError('Cannot find Apache control command apache2ctl',). Skipping.

On Oracle Linux Server, [the Apache control command](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E52668_01/E54669/html/ol7-s2-websvc.html) is `apachectl` just like CentOS/RHEL.

The `/etc/os-release` file [on Oracle Linux](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.000087964) contains `ID=""ol""` which does not match any existing override class. My simple one-line PR adds this missing OS override. After this one-line change is applied, then Certbot Apache plugin works as designed on Oracle Linux.

Without this code change, a hack/workaround for Oracle Linux is [to add (_missing_)](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html#ID_LIKE=) `ID_LIKE=""centos rhel""` to the [`/etc/os-release` file](http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/os-release.html). This forces the Certbot Apache plugin to treat OL like CentOS/RHEL.

The LDSR upscaler relies on the `VQModelInterface` as defined in the `ldm\models\autoencoder.py` of the Compvis Stable Diffusion repo.

This is if you try a non_monotonic selection on a non_unique index (a mouthful)!

Testing for `ssl_module` patterned after `openssl_version()` code here: https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/certbot-apache/certbot_apache/_internal/configurator.py#L274

Previously we were getting tests to pass by setting `ssl_module` to `None`, because `enable_mod` figures out if it needs to enable the mod by [testing inclusion](https://github.com/certbot/certbot/blob/master/certbot-apache/certbot_apache/_internal/override_debian.py#L108).
